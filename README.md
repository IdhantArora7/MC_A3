# Matrix Calculator & WiFi Signal Logger Android Projects

Welcome! This repository contains **two different Android projects**, separated into different Git branches.

| Branch Name        | Project Description                                                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MatrixCalculator` | Android app to perform matrix operations using C++ native code and vector library |
| `WAPsScanner`| Android app to log WiFi signal strengths across multiple locations                |

## ðŸ“œ How to Access Each Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IdhantArora7/MC_A3
   cd MC_A3
   ```

2. Checkout the branch you need:

   - Matrix Calculator:
     ```bash
     git checkout Q1
     ```

   - WiFi Signal Logger:
     ```bash
     git checkout Q2
     ```

Each branch has its own fully independent Android app with its own README.
